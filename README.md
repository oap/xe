## 💡 How it Works (指标说明)

- **RSI < 30:** Oversold condition. The currency may be undervalued (Buying opportunity).
- **RSI > 70:** Overbought condition. The currency may be overvalued (Potential peak).
- **SMA 30 (Orange):** Represents the short-term trend. When the rate stays above SMA 30, it indicates an upward trend.
- **Decision Logic:** The app evaluates if the current rate is trending above its 30-day average while monitoring RSI to avoid "buying the top."
